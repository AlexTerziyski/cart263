# Alex Terziyski: Game-Engine-Jam

 * Game-Engine Jam
 * Alex Terziyski
 * 
 * Prototype for testing out physics without some of Phaser 3 set templates, relying on mathematical calculations instead.
 * 
 * This prototype is a bow and arrow game that explores the possibility of implementing game mechanics and interactions using mathematical formulas instead of built-in physics engines.
 * Players control a bow to shoot arrows at a target bag, aiming to score points. The game features simple physics simulations for arrow trajectory and collision detection.
 * My goal was to experiment with physics interactions without necessarily using Phaser 3's gravity, velocity, physics (just to see if its possible and challenge myself). 
 * 
 * Click/Press your mouse to shoot the arrow at the bag to score points!
